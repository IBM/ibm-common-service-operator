# Install IBM Common Services

Install IBM Common Services on OpenShift 4.3+.

Usually IBM Common Services is packaged into the CloudPaks, if you install CloudPaks you will get IBM Common Services installed automatically.

If you want to install IBM Common Services only, you can follow the steps to install one or more individual common services.

**NOTE: This doc is only for developers and early adopters, please reference IBM Knowledge Center if you are a customer: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSHKN6/kc_welcome_cs.html**


## 1.Create CatalogSource

The CatalogSource is used to host IBM Common Services operators.


```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: opencloud-operators
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  displayName: IBMCS Operators
  publisher: IBM
  sourceType: grpc
  image: quay.io/opencloudio/ibm-common-service-catalog:dev-latest
  updateStrategy:
    registryPoll:
      interval: 45m
```

Open the OpenShift Web Console, click the plus button in top right corner, and then copy the above catalog source into the editor.

![Create OperatorSource](./images/create-operator-source.png)

Check if the CatalogSource pod is running or not:

```bash
oc -n openshift-marketplace get pod | grep opencloud-operators
```

The output is a running pod:

```yaml
opencloud-operators-6k6q8               1/1     Running   0          36m
```

**Note:** Removing the CatalogSource pod will trigger an immediate reload of CatalogSource. And if you are using OpenShift v4.3 cluster, you also need to manually remove the CatalogSource pod to trigger a reload, then the new operators will be updated automatically.

```bash
oc -n openshift-marketplace delete pod -l olm.catalogSource=opencloud-operators
```


## 2.Create a Namespace

Navigate to `Projects` page in OpenShift console left menu, then `Create Project`, e.g., create a project named `common-service`.

## 3.Install IBM Common Service Operator

### Search IBM Common Service Operator in the OperatorHub

Navigate to `OperatorHub` page in OpenShift console, type `ibm-common-service-operator` in the search box.

![Search Operator](./images/search-operator.png)

### Install IBM Common Service Operator

Click and install IBM Common Service Operator into `common-service` namespace.

![Install Preview](./images/install-operator.png)

You can choose the `stable-v1` channel for installing the common service in the last release or choose the `dev` channel to install the latest version.

Waiting for few minutes the IBM Common Service Operator and ODLM will be installed.

![Installed Operators](./images/installed-operators.png)

So far, the IBM Common Service Operator and ODLM operator installation is completed. Next, you can start to install individual common services.

## 4.Install Individual Common Services

Install individual common services by creating an OperandRequest. All these common services will be deployed into the namespace `ibm-common-services`, which cannot be changed.

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.ibm.com/v1alpha1
kind: OperandRequest
metadata:
  name: common-service
  namespace: ibm-common-services
spec:
  requests:
    - operands:
        - name: ibm-cert-manager-operator
        - name: ibm-mongodb-operator
        - name: ibm-iam-operator
        - name: ibm-monitoring-exporters-operator
        - name: ibm-monitoring-prometheusext-operator
        - name: ibm-monitoring-grafana-operator
        - name: ibm-healthcheck-operator
        - name: ibm-management-ingress-operator
        - name: ibm-licensing-operator
        - name: ibm-metering-operator
        - name: ibm-commonui-operator
        - name: ibm-ingress-nginx-operator
        - name: ibm-auditlogging-operator
        - name: ibm-platform-api-operator
        - name: ibm-helm-api-operator
        - name: ibm-helm-repo-operator
        - name: ibm-catalog-ui-operator
      registry: common-service
```

Open the OpenShift Web Console, click the plus button in top right corner, then copy the above OperandRequest into the editor and create.


## 5.Manage Individual Common Service Operators

Navigate to `Installed Operators` page in OpenShift console, click `ODLM` operator and choose project `ibm-common-services`, then click `All Instances`.

Then you can enable or disable one of the individual common services by editing the `OperandRequest`, and update the common service configuration by editing the `OperandConfig`.

![Manage Operators](./images/manage-operators.png)

If you want to uninstall IBM Common Services, you can remove the `OperandRequest` and uninstall IBM Common Service Operator and ODLM operator, then remove the `common-service` namespace.
